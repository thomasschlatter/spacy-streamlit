This repo hosts a [Streamlit Web APP](https://share.streamlit.io/howard-haowen/spacy-streamlit/app.py) that leverages the power of [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to assist language learning. It currently suppports the following languages:

- Mandarin
- English
- Japanese

and now also 

- German

I have added a noun gender analyzer, but sadly I couldnt find a reliable German dictionary api, so I had to remove this part. If you know of a good dictionary api, please let me know.

The update has been pushed to the main branch.
